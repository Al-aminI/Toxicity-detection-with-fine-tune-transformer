# Toxicity-detection-with-fine-tune-transformer

I used Hugging faces transformers pre-trained models.
I specifically uses GPT-2 embedding layer and its tokenizer, then I created an LSTM network with final classification layer
to classify whether content has toxic tokens or not. then train it on a dataset for 3 ephochs

the model is 140MB, so it cant be uploaded here, contact me here alaminibrahim433@gmail.com or chat me to get the complete model.
